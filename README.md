# Tic-Tac-Toe-Learner
A tic-tac-toe game for CSC426

Run this program as follows:
> cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Learner/tic_tac_toe

> python3 main.py

It should be noted that we have misnamed that learned function in the program. We have called it the target_function. This method should really be called learned_function(), or V^.
